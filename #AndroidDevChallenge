Taking steps towards bettering our human world, as a whole. 

	Dear Android Studio, 
My idea consists of developing an application that can not only trigger, but measure a certain chemical release in the brain(Endorphins).
These measurements will then be saved and able to be compared by the user from day to day endorphin release, to assess further results. 
This chemical allows for feeling content, and getting rid of uneasy feelings. 
There is a bunch of applications on the Google Play Store. Games of all sorts, apps that help our daily commutes,
and apps that can help us learn things, etc.
All of these apps that have been created are fun, useful, and offer a stimulating experience. With these comes a problem.
Viewing screens and having to process every pixel used, to bring a screen to life, is causing some serious health issues to the brain
resulting in feeling flustered, loss of energy, irritability, and many more complications. I personally believe this one of the biggest 
contributions to themental illness that many are experiencing. With my idea, and the ability to integrate a certain physical
activity with our cell phones triggering a chemical release, and being able to record and compare (To how well you feel on certain days,
and comparing to the amount of endorphins you have released that day.) I have already learned a lot of the Android Studio platform
and am now starting to learn Java. I ,personally, donâ€™t mind learning everything and launching this application myself,
but I have to be honest, I would love to learn more with you guys by my side, and seeing how we may be able to help each other
succeed in our endeavors. 


											Sincerely,
                                                                                        Kyle Loiacono
